#For the findings of the proposed study of diagnostic accuracy to be robust, we require a minimum number of infected and uninfected cases. The total number of samples required to accurately evaluate the diagnostic devices can be calculated4 using the formula 


#p  the expected sensitivity of the novel diagnostic
p<-0.99

# po is the minimum acceptable level of sensitivity
po<-0.98

po<-c(0.9,0.905,0.91,0.915,0.92,0.925,0.93,0.935,0.94,0.945)

#m is the prevalence of infection in the population

#required specimens gives the number of specimens needed to obtain power to evaluate the diagnostic, whilst satisfying the requirements above. When n is chosen this way, you can design the test to ensure that the  the lower limit of the confidence interval for the estimate of sensitivity/specificity is not likely to exceed p0

#x is the precision with which you want to evaluate, expressed as a proportion. i.e. if you want to evaluate a test that you expect to have a sensitivity or specificity of 95% with precision plus or minus 5%, then x should be 0.05
